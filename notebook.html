The version of Python that ships with OS X is great for learning, 
but it’s not good for development. The version shipped with OS X 
may be out of date from the official current Python release, 
which is considered the stable production version.

(Note: pyenv as an alternative way to install and manage multiple versions of Python, including Python3. It can be installed via homebrew.)
#Download Package mamager
  While OS X comes with a large number of Unix utilities, those familiar with Linux 
  systems will notice one key component missing: a package manager. Homebrew fills this void.

  Once you’ve installed Homebrew, insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line at the bottom of your ~/.profile file

You can't overwrite some packages owned by system Python on OS X (i.e. the python binary that lives in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/..., which you can see if you ask for sys.executable in the interpreter). Using system Python on OS X is not really a good idea, because it can't be updated. Instead, I recommend one of the following approaches (in this order):

using pyenv so you can manage your own Python install
installing directly with .pkg files from python.org
using conda / Anaconda / Miniconda
